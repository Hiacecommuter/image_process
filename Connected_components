1 .4 pixel connectivity and 8 pixel connectivity

2. Connected component labeling
Connected component labeling uses binary images to detect connected regions.
Color images and higher dimensional data can also be used

3. Connected Component labeling Algorithms
-- Recursive Tracking
-- Parallel Growing
-- Row by Row

4. Classical algorithm
-- The first pass to record equivalences and assign temporary labels
-- The second pass to replace each temporary label by the label of its equivalence class


Each pixel is checked from the top left corner to the bottom right corner moving linearly.
For each pixel, only check its above and right

-- check if the pixel is foreground, and move to next if it is background
-- take label of pixel above or left as its label (use the smallest value)
-- if left or above is background, create a new label
-- if the above pixel A and left pixel B, then A B are belong to same.
-- Replace the label according to the links to root label
